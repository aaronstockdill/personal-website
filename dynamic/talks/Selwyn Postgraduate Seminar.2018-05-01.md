# Selwyn Postgraduate Seminar Series
## Automating representation change across domains for reasoning

In preparation for my upcoming second year presentation in the Computer Lab at Cambridge,
I volunteered to speak in the Selwyn Postgraduate Seminar Series.
This was a wonderful opportunity to share my work with the fellows of Selwyn.
I was lucky enough to share this opportunity with Maria Averkiou,
a current masters student in Heritage Studies.

My talk focuses on my current research on representations,
and how automated assistants might decide which representation to suggest to users.
This might be to help the user solve a problem,
or it might be to explain an existing solution better.
Because the audience had a wide background, mostly from outside computer science,
I chose to keep the talk fairly high-level.

The slides are available [as a PDF.](/static/spss.pdf)
