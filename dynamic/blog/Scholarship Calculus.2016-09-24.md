# Scholarship Calculus PowerPoints

This year I ran the Scholarship Calculus programme at [Cashmere High School](http://www.cashmere.school.nz/). It was an amazing opportunity to continue gaining teaching experience, and also gave me a chance to have a go at course design. Part of course design is developing resources, and it turns out that is... not so fun. In the interest of saving others some time and effort, I am making the PowerPoints I created available for free.

These PowerPoints are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike licence. In short, this means two things:
  + First, don't take my name off them!
  + Second, you should let others have access to any changes you make with the same rules.

The PowerPoints are presented in the order I gave them. I'm not sure this is the best order, but hey, it went OK.
