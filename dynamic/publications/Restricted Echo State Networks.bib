    Abstract = {Echo state networks are a powerful type of reservoir neural network, but the reservoir is essentially unrestricted in its original formulation. Motivated by limitations in neuromorphic hardware, we remove combinations of the four sources of memory—leaking, loops, cycles, and discrete time—to determine how these influence the suitability of the reservoir. We show that loops and cycles can replicate each other, while discrete time is a necessity. The potential limitation of energy conservation is equivalent to limiting the spectral radius.}}
