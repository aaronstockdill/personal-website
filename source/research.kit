<h1>Research interests</h1>
<p>I am interested in human-like reasoning and the &ldquo;third wave&rdquo; of artificial intelligence. Humans are capable of finding patterns in remarkably small datasets, learning from just a handful of examples. We use a wide variety of strategies to solve a wide variety of problems. Truly intelligent systems should be able to do likewise. Third-wave AI focuses on systems that can not just make predictions, but form explanations. This goes far beyond the first-wave (<span class='all-caps'>GOFAI</span>, or good old fashioned AI) and second-wave (deep learning) AI. Furthermore, some speculate that third-wave AI might focus on teaching the AIs how to learn, or <em>meta-learning</em>.</p>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="abstract">Choosing how to represent knowledge effectively is a long-standing open problem. Cognitive science has shed light on the taxonomisation of representational systems from the perspective of cognitive processes, but a similar analysis is absent from the perspective of problem solving, where the representations are employed. In this paper we review how representation choices are made for solving problems in the context of theorem proving from three perspectives: cognition, heterogeneity, and computational demands. We contrast the different factors that are most important for each perspective in the context of problem solving to produce a list of considerations for developers of problem solving tools regarding representations that are appropriate for particular users and effective for specific problem domains.</p>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="abstract">We present a framework for assessing the relative cognitive cost of different representational systems for problem solving. The framework consists of 13 cognitive properties. These properties are mapped according to two dimensions: (1) the time scale of the cognitive process, and (2) the granularity of the representational system. The work includes analyses of those processes that are relevant to the internal mental world, and those that are relevant to the external physical display too. The motivation for the construction of this framework is to support the engineering of an automated system that (a) selects representations, (b) that are suited for individual users, (c) and works on specific classes of problems. We present a prototype implementation of such an automated representation selection system, along with an evaluation.</p>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="abstract">Mathematics and computing students learn new concepts and fortify their expertise by solving problems. The representation of a problem, be it through algebra, diagrams, or code, is key to understanding and solving it. Multiple-representation interactive environments are a promising approach, but the task of choosing an appropriate representation is largely placed on the user. We propose a new method to recommend representations based on correspondences: conceptual links between domains. Correspondences can be used to analyse, identify, and construct analogies even when the analogical target is unknown. This paper explains how correspondences build on probability theory and Gentner’s structure-mapping framework; proposes rules for semi-automated correspondence discovery; and describes how correspondences can explain and construct analogies.</p>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="abstract">We present a novel framework for inspecting representations and encoding their formal properties. This enables us to assess and compare the informational and cognitive value of different representations for reasoning. The purpose of our framework is to automate the process of representation selection, taking into account the candidate representation's match to the problem at hand and to the user's specific cognitive profile. This requires a language for talking about representations, and methods for analysing their relative advantages. This foundational work is first to devise a computational end-to-end framework where problems, representations, and user's profiles can be described and analysed. As AI systems become ubiquitous, it is important for them to be more compatible with human reasoning, and our framework enables just that.</p>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="abstract">Recent developments of unconventional hardware using memristors and atomic switch networks has led to renewed interest in hardware neuromorphic solutions. Most hardware models rely upon a reservoir neural network as the basis of any learning, but the distinct differences between software implementations and hardware reality mean what we take for granted in traditional software reservoirs - such as cycles, loops, infinite energy, and discrete time - may be severely limited or unavailable in hardware, raising questions about how a hardware implementation would perform and how to potentially overcome these limitations. Proposed hardware additions, such as an echoer or an input delay mechanism, address some of these limitations.</p>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="abstract">Echo state networks are a powerful type of reservoir neural network, but the reservoir is essentially unrestricted in its original formulation. Motivated by limitations in neuromorphic hardware, we remove combinations of the four sources of memory—leaking, loops, cycles, and discrete time—to determine how these influence the suitability of the reservoir. We show that loops and cycles can replicate each other, while discrete time is a necessity. The potential limitation of energy conservation is equivalent to limiting the spectral radius.</p>

    <h2>Neuromorphic Computing with Reservoir Neural Networks on Memristive Hardware</h2>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="abstract">Building an artificial brain is a goal as old as computer science. Neuromorphic computing takes this in new directions by attempting to physically simulate the human brain. In 2008 this goal received renewed interest due to the memristor, a resistor that has state, and again in 2012 with the atomic switch, a related circuit component. This report details the construction of a simulator for large networks of these devices, including the underlying assumptions and how we model specific physical characteristics. Existing simulations of neuromorphic hardware range from detailed particle-level simulations through to high-level graph-theoretic representations. We develop a simulator that sits in the middle, successfully removing expensive and unnecessary operations from particle simulators while remaining more device-accurate than a wholly abstract representation. We achieve this with a statistical approach, describing distributions from which we draw the ideal values based on a small set of parameters. This report also explores the applications of these memristive networks in machine learning using reservoir neural networks, and their performance in comparison to existing techniques such as echo state networks (ESNs). Neither the memristor nor atomic switch networks are capable of learning time-series sequences, and the underlying cause is found to be restrictions imposed by physical laws upon circuits. We present a series of restrictions upon an ESN, systematically removing loops, cycles, discrete time, and combinations of these three factors. From this we conclude that removing loops and cycles breaks the “infinite memory” of an ESN, and removing all three renders the reservoir totally incapable of learning.</p>
