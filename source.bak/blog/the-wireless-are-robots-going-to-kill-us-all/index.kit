<p>Earlier this week I had a chat with Max Towle from The Wireless about AI, robots, and all things technology.
It was a good bit of fun talking about the really out-there concepts that might come our way,
and what impact technology is going to have on society.
The article is a bit less doom-and-gloom than the usual reports, and well worth a read:
