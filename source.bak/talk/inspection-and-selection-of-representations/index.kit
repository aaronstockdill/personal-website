<h1>Ljubljana 2019</h1>
<h2>Inspection and Selection of Representations</h2>
<p>As part of an ongoing research project closely related to my PhD work,
I was able to give a presentation to
the University of Ljubljana Artificial Intelligence research group.
This was a wonderful experience,
visiting this beautiful city in the wonderful Slovenia.</p>
<p>The talk touches on all the key ideas in our research so far:
properties, correspondences,
and user preferences for representations.
The <a href="/research/#Publications">upcoming paper</a> of the same name
covers the ideas much more thoroughly than I ever could in 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The slides for the presentation are available
<a href="/static_assets/Ljubljana.pdf">in PDF form</a>.</p>
