<h1>Research interests</h1>
<p>I am interested in human-like reasoning and the &ldquo;third wave&rdquo; of artificial intelligence. Humans are capable of finding patterns in remarkably small datasets, learning from just a handful of examples. We use a wide variety of strategies to solve a wide variety of problems. Truly intelligent systems should be able to do likewise. Third-wave AI focuses on systems that can not just make predictions, but form explanations. This goes far beyond the first-wave (<span class='all-caps'>GOFAI</span>, or good old fashioned AI) and second-wave (deep learning) AI. Furthermore, some speculate that third-wave AI might focus on teaching the AIs how to learn, or <em>meta-learning</em>.</p>
