<p>I am currently a Research Fellow in Informatics with the Representational Systems Lab, with Professor Peter Cheng. I am associated with the &lsquo;Rep2rep2&rsquo; project, joint between Sussex and Cambridge. The goal of this project is to intelligently recommend representations to support problem solving, considering both the problem to be solved, and the person doing the solving.</p>

<p>My interests lie with anything that can make the world better. This primarily manifests as education: I have taught mathematics to high school students, and computer science to university students. I also work with Potato Softworks to help businesses and organisations get an online presence with affordable websites. Personally, I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence, as is reflected in my research.</p>

<p>In 2016, I finished studying towards a Bachelor of Science with Honours in Computer Science at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. The title of my dissertation was &ldquo;Neuromorphic Computing with Reservoir Neural Networks on Memristive Hardware.&rdquo; In 2015 I completed my final year of a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics, and in 2017 commenced study towards a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge.</p>
