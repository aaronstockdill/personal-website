## Research

I am interested in human-like reasoning and the “third wave” of artificial intelligence. Humans are capable of finding patterns in remarkably small datasets, learning from just a handful of examples. We use a wide variety of strategies to solve a wide variety of problems. Truly intelligent systems should be able to do likewise. Third-wave AI focuses on systems that can not just make predictions, but form explanations. This goes far beyond the first-wave (GOFAI, or good old fashioned AI) and second-wave (deep learning) AI. Furthermore, some speculate that third-wave AI might focus on teaching the AIs how to learn, or meta-learning.
