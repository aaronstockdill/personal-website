    <h1 lang="EN">About Me</h1>
    <h1 lang="FR">Biographie</h1>

    <p>I'm currently studying towards a Bachelor of Science with Honours in Computer Science at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. The title of my dissertation is "Neuromorphic Computing with Reservoir Neural Networks on Memristive Hardware." In 2015 I completed my final year of a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics, and one day hope to study towards a PhD in Computer Science.</p>

    <p>My interests lie with anything that can make the world better. This primarily manifests as education: I teach mathematics to high school students, and computer science to university students. I also work with Potato Softworks to help businesses and organisations get an online prescence with affordable websites. Personally, I am passionate about Artifical Intelligence, as is reflected in my Honours research.</p>
