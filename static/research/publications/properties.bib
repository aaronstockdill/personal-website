  abstract={We present a framework for assessing the relative cognitive cost of different representational systems for problem solving. The framework consists of 13 cognitive properties. These properties are mapped according to two dimensions: (1) the time scale of the cognitive process, and (2) the granularity of the representational system. The work includes analyses of those processes that are relevant to the internal mental world, and those that are relevant to the external physical display too. The motivation for the construction of this framework is to support the engineering of an automated system that (a) selects representations, (b) that are suited for individual users, (c) and works on specific classes of problems. We present a prototype implementation of such an automated representation selection system, along with an evaluation.},
